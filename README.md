### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.

## Current concept

The existing mainstream collaborative document editor is Google Drive. While the Google Drive ecosystem is well-featured in editing capabilities, yet the format can't be used elsewhere, and Google has the ability to read all your data, rendering it insecure for many companies, nonprofits, charities, and governmental organisations.

Long thunder would aim to give people and organisations the ability to control their own data storage, by linking their own servers or a cloud storage provider (like Dropbox), to store the data. Long thunder's own storage service, would also be available.

Long thunder would provide the collaborative editing features, storage, and mobile apps. Long thunder would also provide a messaging service, to message fellow organisation members, or Long thunder users.

Profit can be gained from:

Sale of cloud storage.
Pro version, providing collaboration and sharing with 5+ users, plus extra storage.
Business accounts, providing administration for large numbers of users.
